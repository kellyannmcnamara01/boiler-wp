## Naming Conventions
The naming convention for this site is heavily based off of [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/). Below is an example of how the name convention should be used.

### CSS Breakdown

```css
/* Block Element */
.card {}

/* Element Dependent on Block Element */
.card__title {}

/* Modifier That Changes Base Element */
.btn {
    &--large {}
}
```

### HTML Breakdown

```html
/* Block Element */
class="card"

/* Element Dependent on Block Element */
class="card__title"

/* Modifier That Changes Base Element */
class="btn btn--large"
```

### JS Actions
- When changing the state of an element with js use class names such as `is-open`, `is-hiding`, `is-fixed` to show/describe the change of state
- Elements that are targeted by js should have a duplicated class name with the addition of `js--` in front. An example of that is `clas-name js--class-name`, this way the scss will not get cluttered with the additional `js--` and it is easier for a dev to see what elements within the html are targeted by js. This being said if there is a popup and a popup button, you only need to add the additional `js--` to the button, which is the trigger. 

```html
<!-- Before Interacted with -->
class="accordion__trigger js--accordion__trigger"

<!-- After Interacted with -->
class="accordion__trigger js--accordion__trigger is-open"
```

### Comments
Comments should help keep the code clean and easy to scan. All comments should be the same base. Below are examples.

```html
<!-- Comment Placement
============================================= -->
```

```php
/* Comment Placement
============================================= */
```

```css
/* Comment Placement
============================================= */
```

```js
/* Comment Placement
============================================= */
```

## Accessibility

### E-readers Text
The global class `e-reader-only` will visually hide anything it is attached to but still allows an e-reader to get the content in order of the html. Best used on `div` or `span` tags

#### E-readers Text Example

```html
<span class="e-reader-only">Only e-readers can see this copy</span>
```

### Skip to Main Content Btn
Part of Context's accessibility standards is to ensure we have a working *Skip to Main Content* btn for e-readers. Within the header this button is included. It currently is set up to skip the top-bar and go to the html element with the id of `main-content`. It is critical that this is working on every template. 

#### Skip to Main Content Btn Example

```html
<a class="e-reader-only" href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>
```

### Accessible Cards
Accessible card (or block links) have been placed in the `partials/posts/content-excerpt.php` file as well as in the `assets/src/scripts/scripts.js` file. Accessible cards also have it's own scss file withing `assets/src/styles/partials/__accessible-cards.scss`. This scss file is **not for styling individual** card types. Individual card types should live in files such as `__post-card.scss`. To make a card accessible there are two html elements that are required:
1. The card container
2. A single link within the container

The card container should have:
- an id; example: `id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>"`
- the classes `accessible-card js--accessible-card`

The single link within the container should have:
- the attr `accessible-card-link` set to match the card container's id; example `accessible-card-link="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>"`
- the classes `accessible-card__link js--accessible-card__link`

You do not need to add additional aria tags or other attrs to the card container or the card. 
Again, it's **important** not to use the accessible card classes as style elements, but rather only when an element should be a block link.

#### Accessible Card Example

```html
<li id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>"  <?php post_class( 'post-card accessible-card js--accessible-card' ); ?> >
    <h1>Title Placement<h1>
    <p>Copy Placement...</p>
    <a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>" class="post-card__link accessible-card__link js--accessible-card__link" accessible-card-link="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>">Link</a>
</li>
```

## Ensuring IE Styling
- After the closing div of every `row` insure you add a div with the class `clear-float`
- The grid scss file is already set up to work so do not edit it unless necessary
- Duplicate the mixins, typography and variables from /src/styles/globals to src/ie-styles/globals
- Make the appropriate adjustments within the correct scss files/folders 


---


## The Customizer
Currently built into the customer are the following items:

### Footer Legal Customization 
This allows you to currently edit the privacy policy page, terms of conditions and the copyright statement. In the theme's customizer, you can edit this under: `customizing -> context custom panel -> footer settings`. If you wish to edit this in the code by editing/adding/removing options you can do by editing `includes/customizer/footer.php`. If you would like to echo any of these custom options within the theme look up `the_permalink( get_theme_mod() )` function. – The current example of these ones are in the `footer.php` file

### Social Links Customization
This allows you to currently edit the social media links in `customizing -> context custom panel -> social settings`. If you wish to edit this in the code by editing/adding/removing options you can do by editing `includes/customizer/social.php`. If you would like to echo any of these custom options within the theme look up `the_permalink( get_theme_mod() )` function. – The current example of these ones are in the `partials/reusables/social-links.php` file

### Back to top btn customization
Within the customizer a client can toggle the back to top btn on or off within `customizing -> context custom panel -> miscellaneous settings`. If you wish to edit this in the code by removing this option you can do by editing `includes/customizer/misc.php`. If you would like to echo any of these custom options within the theme look up `the_permalink( get_theme_mod() )` function. – The current example of these ones are in the `partials/reusables/back-top-top.php` file


---


## Accordions
There is a reusable file you can call within a loop when you want to add an accordion. The path to this reusable is: `partials/reusables/accordion.php`. This is currently not set up to hook into WP's admin area.

It is important that each accordion has the following attrs set as unique strings:
- the trigger should have a unique id
- the panel should have a unique id
- the trigger's aria-controls should match the pannel's id
- the pannel's aria-labelledby should match the trigger's id

Here is an example of the accordion html markup
```html
<div class="accordion" style="padding: 30px; font-size: 16px; background: firebrick;">
    <button id="accordion-1-btn" class="accordion__trigger js--accordion__trigger" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion-id-1">Accordion One
        <span class="e-reader-only">Open Accordion</span>
    </button>
    <div id="accordion-id-1" class="accordion__panel" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion-1-btn" hidden="true" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false">
        <p>Accordion One: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
    </div>
</div>
```


---


## Tooltips
Tooltips can either be buttons or inline text. The reusable is file is set up in `partials/reusables/tooltip.php`. This is currently not set up to hook into WP's admin area.

It is important that each tooltip has the following attrs set as unique strings:
- the trigger should have a unique id
- the panel should have a unique id
- the trigger's aria-controls should match the pannel's id
- the pannel's aria-labelledby should match the trigger's id

Here is an example of the tooltip button:
```html
<span class="tooltip" style="background: khaki;">
    <button id="tooltip-2-btn" class="tooltip__trigger tooltip__trigger--btn js--tooltip__trigger" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="tooltip-id-2">Tooltip Btn</button>
    <span id="tooltip-id-2" class="tooltip__panel" role="tooltip" aria-labelledby="tooltip-2-btn" hidden="true" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false">Tooltip copy placement.</span>
</span>
```

To convert a tooltip to be inline, simply swap the class `tooltip__trigger--btn` for `tooltip__trigger--inline`


---


## Footnotes
Footnotes a set up in a reusable located `partials/reusables/footnote.php`. This is currently not set up to hook into WP's admin area.

It is important that each footnote has the following attrs set as unique strings:
- the trigger should have a unique id
- the pannel should have a unique id
- the trigger's aria-controls should match the pannel's id
- the pannel's aria-labelledby should match the trigger's id
- the close btn's `content-panel` should match the pannel's id
- the close btn's `content-trigger` should match the trigger's id

Here is an example of a footnote:
```html
<div class="footnote" style="padding: 30px; font-size: 16px; background: thistle;">
    <button id="footnote-1-btn" class="footnote__trigger js--footnote__trigger" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="footnote-id-1">Footnote One
        <span class="e-reader-only">Open footnote</span>
    </button>
    <div id="footnote-id-1" class="footnote__panel" role="region" aria-labelledby="footnote-1-btn" hidden="true" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false">
        <div>
            <p>Footnote One: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque ac lectus est.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="footnote__close-btn" content-panel="footnote-id-1" content-trigger="footnote-1-btn">
            <span><span class="e-reader-only">Close footnote</span></span>
            <span></span>
        </button>
    </div>
</div>
```

*Note: Essentially the footnote currently is a button that triggers a popover*


---


## Smooth Scroll
To activate smooth scroll you need a button/link and an element with an id. 
```html
<button scroll="placement-id">Scroll to placement id</button>
<h1 id="placement-id">Placement ID Title</h1>
```

*Note: You can use this for the page navigation: `partials/reusables/nav-page.php`. Page nav should be placed outside of the `<main>` tag.*


---


## Cookies
Within `assets/scr/scripts/partials/cookies.js` you will find reusable functions to creating cookies. Use the `getCookie()` and the `acceptCookie()` functions to create cookies for anything you need. **Note:** if you use cookies you much include a banner saying so, along with a privacy policy page. This page is typically created by the client's legal team and should be pointed out as a task for the client early in the project. 


---


## Search Highlight
At the bottom of the search php page you will find a script. *It is required to be there due to the direct php we are echoing into the js.* At the very bottom of it you will see that the `highlightSearchedTerm()` is being called and passing through the elements that the function needs to look through. I have it set particularly like that so the page doesn't crash go through every element on it. Update the elements to adjust to your theme's html markup.


___


## Breadcrumbs
Breadcrumbs will echo out the parent levels, or corresponding page titles. To echo breadcumbs simply place the code snippet `<?php breadcrumbs(); ?>`. Currently this code snippet is being called in all headers. To access the breadcrumb function go to `includes/front/breadcrumbs.php`. 

*Accessibility Note: the separators are created using sudo elements becuase e-readers will try and read them otherwise.*


___


## Post View Count
Within `includes/front/post-views.php` there is functionality that counts the total views of a **post** and allows you to display that count by calling the function `<?php echo context_get_post_view(); ?>`. For the post to have the functionality to count views you **must include** `<?php get_template_part( 'includes/front/post-views' ); ?>` **on all posts**.

You can also filter a WP_Query by post views by adding the following lines of php in the query array.
```php
'meta_key' => 'post_views_count',
'orderby' => 'meta_value_num', 
'order' => 'DESC'
```

*Note: `post_views_count` is a new field created in the database when a page is viewed. For pages to appear within filters using the `post_views_count` field a page must have one view, otherwise the post won't have that field in the admin* 

*Additional Note: If you are loged into the admin panel your views will not be counted.*

## Ajax Filtering
For ajax filtering to work there are three main files.
1. `partials/reusables/filters-posts.php` - the front end filters
2. `assets/src/scripts/partials/ajax-filters.js` – the ajax calls
3. `includes/front/post-filters.php` – the php queries

### Front-end Filters
`partials/reusables/filters-posts.php`

How to set up filters
1. Set up `$adminAjax` var to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` file
2. Set up the different query arrays as vars
3. Create a form tag with an id and action set to the $adminAjax location
4. Within the form add your fields that use the query array vars from step 1
5. At the bottom of the form add a hidden field that connects to the functions.php -> add_action();
    - **IMPORTANT**: the hidden field in step 5, it's value should match the add_action()s in functions.php 
    - hidden field's value: `value="FIELD_VALUE"`
    - functions.php add action: `add_action( 'wp_ajax_FIELD_VALUE', 'SITENAME_POST_FILTER_FUNCTION_NAME' );`
    - functions.php add action: `add_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_FIELD_VALUE', 'SITENAME_POST_FILTER_FUNCTION_NAME' );`
6. Create a div that will replace it's current contents with the filtered contents
7. Edit corresponding js file found: assets/src/scripts/partials.ajax-filters.js
8. Edit corresponsing php file found: includes/front/post-filters.php 

Currently filters are set up to allow for multiple fields to filter by category. You can also filter by tags, popularity, newst, oldest, start/end date and change the layout from rows to blocks. 

### Ajax Calls
`assets/src/scripts/partials/ajax-filters.js`

How to create a ajaxPostsFilter function

1. Create a function
2. Create a var that gets the form by it's id
3. Create an ajax instance and within it:
    - Set the url to the form's action
    - Set the datatype to serialize()
    - Set type to form's method (POST)
    - Set beforeSend to trigger loader of choice
    - Set success to fill div with results by grabbing the id
    - **IMPORTANT**: this will remove all the current content's and replace it with the ajax results
4. Return false after ajax instance
5. Create triggers to call the filter function
    - Example: $('#form input').change(function(){YourFilterFunction();});

### PHP Filter Queries

## Icon Library
For icons we use [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app). It allows us to either select from their icons or upload svg icons of our own into projects and then export them into jason/css. 

To update the current icomoon library, simple head to [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app) and click `import icons` -> navigate to the `assets/fonts/icomoon` folder and select the `selection.json` file. When you upload that file into icomoon it will load all out current icons. It's **important** to always upload the current selection.json file so we don't loose icons. Then once uploaded, load the project, import icons and make sure they are all part of the same group. Then click export. 

When naming the svg files you upload makesure you **do not** include the name icon in the file name. Icomoon will automatically add the word `icon-` infront of every icon. 

Additionally, to make sure that icons are accessible it is **required** to add `role="img"` to the `<i>` tag.
